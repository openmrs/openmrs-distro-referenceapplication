# OpenMRS 3.0 Reference Application

This project holds the build configuration for the OpenMRS 3.0 reference application, found on
https://dev3.openmrs.org and https://o3.openmrs.org.

## Quick start

### Build the distribution

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Run the app

```bash
docker compose up
```

The OpenMRS 3.x UI is accessible at http://localhost/openmrs/spa

OpenMRS Legacy UI is accessible at http://localhost/openmrs

### Production deployment with SSL

For production deployments with HTTPS/SSL certificates:

```bash
SSL_MODE=prod \
CERT_WEB_DOMAINS=your-domain.com \
CERT_CONTACT_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up
```

See the [SSL/HTTPS Configuration](#sslhttps-configuration) section for detailed setup instructions.

## Overview

This distribution consists of four images:

- **db** - This is just the standard MariaDB image supplied to use as a database
- **backend** - This image is the OpenMRS backend. It is built from the main Dockerfile included in the root of the project and
  based on the core OpenMRS Docker file. Additional contents for this image are drawn from the `distro` sub-directory which
  includes a full Initializer configuration for the reference application intended as a starting point.
- **frontend** - This image is a simple nginx container that embeds the 3.x frontend, including the modules described in the
  `frontend/spa-assemble-config.json` file.
- **gateway** - This image is an nginx reverse proxy that sits in front of the `backend` and `frontend` containers
  and provides a common interface to both. This helps mitigate CORS issues.

When running with SSL enabled (using `docker-compose.ssl.yml`), an additional service is included:

- **certbot** - This image is used for generating and renewing SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or self-signed)

## SSL/HTTPS Configuration

The application can be run with SSL/HTTPS support for both development and production environments.

### Development mode (self-signed certificates)

For local development with HTTPS, simply run with the SSL compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up
```

This will:
- Automatically generate self-signed certificates for `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
- Configure nginx to use HTTPS on port 443
- Redirect HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS
- **No internet connection required**

The application will be accessible at:
- https://localhost/openmrs/spa
- https://127.0.0.1/openmrs/spa

**Note**: Your browser will show a security warning for self-signed certificates. This is expected - click "Advanced" and proceed to the site.

### Production mode (Let's Encrypt)

For production deployments with valid SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt:

```bash
SSL_MODE=prod \
CERT_WEB_DOMAINS=example.com \
CERT_CONTACT_EMAIL=admin@example.com \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up
```

**Configuration options**:

- `SSL_MODE=prod` - Use Let's Encrypt certificates (required)
- `CERT_WEB_DOMAINS` - Your domain name(s), comma-separated (e.g., `example.com,www.example.com`)
- `CERT_CONTACT_EMAIL` - Email for Let's Encrypt notifications
- `SSL_STAGING=true` - (Optional) Use Let's Encrypt staging environment for testing

**The certbot container will**:
1. Create a temporary certificate to allow nginx to start
2. Wait for nginx to be ready
3. Request a real Let's Encrypt certificate via ACME HTTP-01 challenge
4. Reload nginx with the real certificate
5. Run a renewal daemon that checks for renewal every 12 hours

**Important**: Ensure your domain's DNS is correctly configured to point to your server before starting, as Let's Encrypt needs to verify domain ownership via HTTP.

### Testing with Let's Encrypt staging

To test the SSL setup without hitting Let's Encrypt rate limits:

```bash
SSL_MODE=prod \
SSL_STAGING=true \
CERT_WEB_DOMAINS=example.com \
CERT_CONTACT_EMAIL=admin@example.com \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up
```

Staging certificates won't be trusted by browsers but allow you to verify the setup works correctly.

### Environment variables reference

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SSL_MODE` | `dev` | `dev` for self-signed certificates, `prod` for Let's Encrypt |
| `SSL_STAGING` | `false` | Use Let's Encrypt staging environment (set to `true` for testing) |
| `CERT_WEB_DOMAINS` | `localhost,127.0.0.1` | Comma-separated list of domain names |
| `CERT_WEB_DOMAIN_COMMON_NAME` | (first domain) | Override the primary domain name |
| `CERT_CONTACT_EMAIL` | (empty) | Email for Let's Encrypt notifications (required in prod mode) |
| `CERT_RSA_KEY_SIZE` | `4096` | RSA key size for certificates |

## Contributing to the configuration

This project uses the [Initializer](https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer) module
to configure metadata for this project. The Initializer configuration can be found in the configuration
subfolder of the distro folder. Any files added to this will be automatically included as part of the
metadata for the RefApp.

Eventually, we would like to split this metadata into two packages:

- `openmrs-core`, which will contain all the metadata necessary to run OpenMRS
- `openmrs-demo`, which will include all of the sample data we use to run the RefApp

The `openmrs-core` package will eventually be a standard part of the distribution, with the `openmrs-demo`
provided as an optional add-on. Most data in this configuration _should_ be regarded as demo data. We
anticipate that implementation-specific metadata will replace data in the `openmrs-demo` package,
though they may use that metadata as a starting point for that customization.

To help us keep track of things, we ask that you suffix any files you add with either
`-core_demo` for files that should be part of the demo package and `-core_data` for
those that should be part of the core package. For example, a form named `test_form.json` would become
`test_core-core_demo.json`.

Frontend configuration can be found in `frontend/config-core_demo.json`.

Thanks!
